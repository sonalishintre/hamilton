    ### How to Use the Updated Script

    1.  **Install the `flit` module**:
        ```bash
        pip install flit
        ```
    2.  **Configure the Script**: The script now supports multiple Hamilton packages.
        Available packages: hamilton, sdk, lsp, contrib, ui
    3.  **Prerequisites**:
        * You must have `git`, `gpg`, `svn`, and the `flit` Python module installed.
        * Your GPG key and SVN access must be configured for your Apache ID.
    4.  **Run the Script**:
        Open your terminal, navigate to the root of your project directory, and run the script
        with the desired package, version, release candidate number, and Apache ID.

    Note: if you have multiple gpg keys, specify the default in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf add a line with `default-key <KEYID>`.

    Use --no-sign (-ns) to skip GPG signing (e.g., when a key is not available locally).
    This implicitly sets --no-upload, since unsigned artifacts must never be published.
    Use --no-upload (-nu) alone to build and sign without publishing (e.g., to rehearse signing).

    Examples:
        python apache_release_helper.py --package hamilton 1.89.0 0 your_apache_id
        python apache_release_helper.py --package sdk 0.8.0 0 your_apache_id
        python apache_release_helper.py --package lsp 0.1.0 0 your_apache_id
        python apache_release_helper.py --package contrib 0.0.8 0 your_apache_id
        python apache_release_helper.py --package ui 0.0.17 0 your_apache_id
        python apache_release_helper.py -ns --package ui 0.0.18 0
